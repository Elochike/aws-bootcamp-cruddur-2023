# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

**WHy do we need containers?**
- Containers make the appps more portable   
- it reuces time spent on configuration
ease on deployment (you can easily kill and start up again)
- it allows you to be closer to the end environment you plan on deploying when testing applications 
- it prevents you from destroing things that could cause that could cause misconfiguration.
- without containerization you get exposed to variants on your system or different versions of a particular package (modules) with containers it simply fies everything by having that baswline to worrkwith which others can adopt and test that it works with that environment.
